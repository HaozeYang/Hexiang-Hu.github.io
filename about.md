## About the site
* * *

### Mixture of Things

I would like to make this simple site function as a mixture platform for blogs, online portfolio, and personal announcements center, so as to record my path as a programming ape. The content will include both technical and non-technical staff, and may potentially vary a lot with each other.

### Public notebook
Maybe I will use it to take quick notes... Not sure if this will be possible

### Idea collector
Idea comes and goes, and I would catch some and put them here
